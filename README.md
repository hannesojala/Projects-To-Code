# Projects-To-Code
A list of projects that will one day be started and inevitably abandoned.

# "Serious" Projects
### Algorithm Visualizer
Website with animations to visualize algorithms on basic data structures such as trees, graphs, lists, and other data structures.
### 3D Rendering engine
Engine to render 3D meshes with texture and shaders using OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX.
- Extension: Non Euclidean Engine - Renders non Euclidean geometry
### Neural Network that does... something
Hopefully something at least a little new.
### Ray Tracer
A 3D renderer that uses ray tracing for soft shadows, global illumination, and reflections.
Traces for more than just spheres.

# Little things
### NBody 2D/3D
Simulates 2D N-Body interactions. O(n<sup>2</sup>) is not good enough!
- Use Barnes-Hut simulation algorithm or
- Use Fast Multipole method
### Image to ASCII
Create an ascii image from a pixel image.
### Marching Cubes Demo
Convert a voxel map into a mesh for export.
### Simple Vector Art
Allows a user to draw with splines, curves, polygons, and line segments.
### Maze generator
Implements a variety of maze generation techniques.
### Dun-gen
Generates a dungeon, perhaps for a table top role playing game.
### Particle Life
A simulation like Game of Life, but instead of a cellular automata it is implemented as a particle-force simulation.
### Multi Level Generation
Generates a universe with many orders of magnitude of detail. (Such as human scale to galactic scale)
### BOIDS Simulation
Bird-like... things.. do stuff...

# Games
### Console tetris
Tetris, but in the terminal. Exciting.
### Block Game
A sandbox crafting blo- Ok its a minecraft clone.
### Space flight Simulator
Like Kerbal Space Program, but with less realistic physics and more violence.
### Explautoma
An RPG based on falling sand games. (Totally not a Noita clone)
### Tank Game
Like Worms, but perhaps with a CA physics engine.
### Some sort of typing game
Something like bisqwit's?
