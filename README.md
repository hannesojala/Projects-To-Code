# Projects-To-Code
A list of projects that will one day be started and inevitably abandoned.

# "Serious" Projects
### Algorithm Visualizer - JS
Website with animations to visualize algorithms on basic data structures such as trees, graphs, lists, and other data structures.
- Add and remove components
- Step by step view of usual ADT operation
### 3D Rendering engine - C++
Engine to render 3D meshes with texture and shaders using OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX.
- Extension: Non Euclidean Engine - Renders non Euclidean geometry
### Neural Network that does... something - Py
Hopefully something at least a little new.
- Denoising impl.? (Not new...)
### Ray Tracer - C++
A 3D renderer that uses ray tracing for soft shadows, global illumination, and reflections.
- Real time version in 3D Rendering engine?

# Little things
### NBody 2D/3D - C++
Simulates 2D N-Body interactions. O(n<sup>2</sup>) is not good enough!
- Use Barnes-Hut simulation algorithm or
- Use Fast Multipole method or
- Use Particle Mesh Method or
- Some algorithm using trees/meshes/multipoles like the above alorithms.
- Resources: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15850c-s96/www/nbody.html
- Would be cool as an online toy. So not C++.
### Image to ASCII
Create an ascii image from a pixel image.
- Shader implementation?
### Marching Cubes Demo - C++
Convert a voxel map into a mesh for export.
- Use in game with 3D noise, or don't and make it a cube game.
### Simple Vector Art
Allows a user to draw with splines, curves, polygons, and line segments.
- Pixel art features?
### Maze generator
Implements a variety of maze generation techniques.
- Tarkowski...
### Dun-gen
Generates a dungeon, perhaps for a table top role playing game.
### Particle Life
A simulation like Game of Life, but instead of a cellular automata it is implemented as a particle-force simulation.
### Multi Level Generation
Generates a universe with many orders of magnitude of detail. (Such as human scale to galactic scale)
### BOIDS Simulation
Bird-like... things.. do stuff...
### Sudoku Solver
Solves Sudoku puzzles.
### Pathfinding demo
Demos various pathfinding algorithms.

# Games
### Console tetris
Tetris, but in the terminal. Exciting.
### Block Game - C++
A sandbox crafting blo- Ok its a minecraft clone.
### Space flight Simulator - C++
Like Kerbal Space Program, but with less (?) realistic physics and more violence.
- Incorporate various generation methods
- Multi Level Gen + Marching Cubes + 3D Noise
### Explautoma - C++
An RPG based on falling sand games. (Totally not a Noita clone)
### Tank Game - C++
Like Worms, but perhaps with a CA physics engine like above.
### Some sort of typing game
Something like bisqwit's?
