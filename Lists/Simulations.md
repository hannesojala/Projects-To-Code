# Simulations

- ~~NBody 2D/3D - C++~~ [_Started_](https://github.com/hannesojala/NBody2D)
  - Simulates 2D N-Body interactions. O(n<sup>2</sup>) is not good enough!
    - Use Barnes-Hut simulation algorithm or
    - Resources: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15850c-s96/www/nbody.html
    - Would be cool as an online toy. So not C++.
- Particle Life
  - A simulation like Game of Life, but instead of a cellular automata it is implemented as a particle-force simulation.us
- Chemistry Simulator
  - real or analogous
  - Could result in particle life with certain chemistries
    - Real chemistry life simulation would be holy grail... (and not likely to be figured out by the lieks of me)
- BOIDS Simulation
  - Bird-like... things.. do stuff...
- Physics Sim askin to Terry Davis' SimStructure
  - Masses and springs, ropes and thrusters
