# Simulations

- ~~NBody 2D/3D - C++~~ (Started)
  - Simulates 2D N-Body interactions. O(n<sup>2</sup>) is not good enough!
    - Use Barnes-Hut simulation algorithm or
    - Resources: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15850c-s96/www/nbody.html
    - Would be cool as an online toy. So not C++.
- Particle Life
  - A simulation like Game of Life, but instead of a cellular automata it is implemented as a particle-force simulation.
- BOIDS Simulation
  - Bird-like... things.. do stuff...
